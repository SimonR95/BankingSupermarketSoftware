A combination of a Banking and Supermarket GUI, this application allows you to perform the following on the Supermarket side: 

- Create new user accounts 
- Purchase/refill stock
- Add new Products to the store line-up
- Create Baskets and Wishlists of desired products 
- View Purchase history and more

and the following on the Banking side:

- Create new user accounts 
- Withdraw/Deposit funds
- Create different types of Current Accounts which will accrue different rates of interest
- View Transaction History
- View/Edit Bank Branch and Head Office details
- Create/Edit Customers and more

## Running

The application can be run simply by starting the [BankingSupermarketSoftware.jar](BankingSupermarketSoftware.jar) executable. Please be wary of the fact that the system will create text files in the local directory to hold information in, and it is thus advised to store the application in it's own folder to prevent clutter.
